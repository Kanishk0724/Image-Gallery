# Image-Gallery <br>

**This image gallery application allows users to:**
-Upload multiple images at once
-View all uploaded images in a responsive grid layout
-Search for images by filename
-Download individual images
-Delete images from the gallery
-Click on images to view them in a larger modal window

_The gallery uses Local Storage to save the images in the browser, so they'll persist even when the page is refreshed._
_Note that Local Storage has limited capacity (usually 5-10MB), so for a production application, you might want to implement server-side storage._

**Key features of this implementation:**
-Modern, responsive design that works on mobile and desktop
-Clean, intuitive user interface
-Smooth animations and transitions
-Search functionality
-Image management (download/delete)
